---

## 🎯 FASTEST METHOD: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (No CLI needed)

### **Step 1: Push to GitHub (2 minutes)**

You need to create a GitHub repository first. Here's how:

1. **Go to GitHub** → https://github.com/new
2. **Create a new repository** named `Joynex`
3. **Don't** initialize with README (your code is ready)
4. **Copy the repository URL** (should be like: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Joynex.git`)

Then run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Joynex.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### **Step 2: Deploy on Vercel (3 minutes)**

1. **Go to Vercel** → https://vercel.com
2. Click **"Import Project"** or **"Add New..."** → **"Project"**
3. **Import from GitHub** → Select your `Joynex` repository
4. **Configure Project:**
   - Framework Preset: **Vite** (should auto-detect)
   - Root Directory: **./** (leave as default)
   - Build Command: `npm run build` (auto-filled)
   - Output Directory: `dist` (auto-filled)

5. **Add Environment Variables** (IMPORTANT):
   Click "Environment Variables" and add:
   ```
   Name: VITE_SUPABASE_URL
   Value: your_supabase_project_url
   
   Name: VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   Value: your_supabase_anon_key
   
   Name: VITE_API_URL
   Value: https://joynex.online/api
   
   Name: VITE_APP_NAME
   Value: Joynex
   
   Name: VITE_APP_URL
   Value: https://joynex.online
   ```

6. Click **"Deploy"** 🚀

Wait 1-2 minutes for the build to complete!

### **Step 3: Add Your Domain (1 minute)**

After deployment:

1. Go to your project → **Settings** → **Domains**
2. Click **"Add"**
3. Enter: `joynex.online`
4. Click **"Add"**

Vercel will give you DNS instructions.

### **Step 4: Update DNS (Configure at your domain registrar)**

Go to where you bought `joynex.online` and add these DNS records:

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.21.21
TTL: 3600

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL: 3600
```

**Alternative (if the above doesn't work):**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: @
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com

Type: CNAME  
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### **Step 5: Wait for DNS Propagation**

- **Minimum:** 5-15 minutes
- **Maximum:** 24-48 hours
- **Usually:** 15-30 minutes

## 🔥 ALTERNATIVE: Deploy via CLI (If you prefer)

```bash
# Login to Vercel (will open browser)
npx vercel login

# Deploy to production
npx vercel --prod

# Follow the prompts:
# - Set up and deploy: Yes
# - Which scope: Your account
# - Link to existing project: No
# - What's your project's name: Joynex
# - In which directory: ./ (just press Enter)
# - Want to override settings: No

# Add domain
npx vercel domains add joynex.online
```

Then update DNS as shown above.

## 📋 Quick Checklist

Before deploying, make sure you have:

- [ ] Supabase account created (https://supabase.com)
- [ ] Supabase project URL and anon key
- [ ] GitHub account (https://github.com)
- [ ] Vercel account (https://vercel.com) - free!
- [ ] Access to your domain registrar (to update DNS)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Build failed"
- Check that environment variables are set in Vercel
- Make sure they all start with `VITE_`

### "Domain not working"
- DNS takes time to propagate (15-30 mins usually)
- Check DNS with: `dig joynex.online` or use https://dnschecker.org
- Make sure DNS records point to Vercel's servers

### "Environment variables not working"
- They must start with `VITE_` prefix
- Redeploy after adding them: Deployments → ... → Redeploy

Your site will be live at:
- ✅ https://joynex.online (after DNS propagates)
- ✅ https://joynex.vercel.app (immediately available)

## 📞 Next Steps After Going Live

1. **Set up Supabase tables** (see SETUP_GUIDE.md)
2. **Test all pages** on your live site
3. **Set up analytics** (Google Analytics, Plausible)
4. **Monitor errors** (Sentry)
5. **Share with the world!** 🌍
