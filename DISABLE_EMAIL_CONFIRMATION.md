# ðŸš« Disable Supabase Email Confirmation

Supabase sends a confirmation email by default when users sign up. To disable this and allow immediate signup:

## Steps to Disable Email Confirmation

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://app.supabase.com/project/spqyigrtimsuqhzebedn

2. **Navigate to Authentication Settings**
   - Click **"Authentication"** in the left sidebar
   - Click **"Providers"** tab
   - Find **"Email"** provider

3. **Disable Email Confirmation**
   - Scroll down to **"Email Confirmation"** section
   - **Toggle OFF** the "Enable email confirmations" switch
   - Click **"Save"**

## Alternative: Auto-confirm Emails

If you want to keep email confirmation enabled but auto-confirm for testing:

1. Go to **Authentication â†’ Settings**
2. Find **"Email Auth"** section
3. Toggle **"Confirm email"** to **OFF**

## After Making Changes

Once you've disabled email confirmation in Supabase:
- Users will be able to sign up and log in immediately
- No confirmation email will be sent
- The app will work smoothly for testing

**Current Issue:** Supabase is sending "Confirm your signup" emails even though we removed the verification page from the app. This setting needs to be changed on the Supabase dashboard.
